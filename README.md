# SLIR-MWSU

This project seeks to simulate disease spread in a student population using a cellular automaton

## Quick and dirty directory map

`main.py` is the actual project code

`main_old.py` is a previous version of `main.py` that I use for personal reference

`params.json` is a set of parameters used by `main.py`. They range from the size of the cellular automaton grid and population size and age demographics to disease metrics like max and min latency period.

## Current state of the project

Need documentation and some features still need to be added. ALMOST DONE
