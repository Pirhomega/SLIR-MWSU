UPCOMING CHANGES AS OF 2020-10-7

+ Add support for simultaneous simulation of multiple diseases
+ Add support for different kinds of Individuals (human and animal, like swine or birds)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2020-08-31 - version 1.00

2020-09-01 - version 1.01

+ Added "Individual" class and moved necessary code for this class from main
+ Added capability for individuals to move around the grid towards a randomly determined location, generating a new one when that location is reached
+ Added "Constants.py" script to hold all immmutable values from parameter file. Constants can be imported to any other script in the same module
+ Added state list to track numbers of susceptible, latent, infectious, and recovered individuals
+ Added output file to which each day's state list can be printed
- Removed need for multiple grids from main.py; simulation can run with one NxN grid

2020-09-13 - version 1.02

+ Added visualization functionality to display each day's state as a .png, where each cell with an Individual within will have a colored tile relative to the Individual's state of health
+ Changed code to be more organized

2020-09-14 - version 1.03

+ Added resource and output folders as referenced values in the parameter file
+ Changed code to reflect above addition
+ Added documentation to "constants.py", "main.py", and "Individual.py"
+ Changed library importing strategy to only import used constructs and functions

2020-09-14 - version 1.04

+ Added ability for Individuals to die and stop moving around the grid during a simulation

2020-09-16 - version 1.05

+ Added vizualizer class with documentation and moved necessary code from main to that class

2020-09-17 - version 1.06

+ Fixed incorrect calculation which caused more people to die from the disease than indicated in the parameter file
+ Changed exposure points data type from integer to float
+ Changed maximum grid size from a theoretical 1000 x 1000 to a theoretical 5000 x 5000
+ Added functionality that allows exposure points to be accumulated slower if neighboring Individuals are wearing masks
+ Added user capability to allow or disallow the program to create a .gif of the simulation

2020-09-20 - version 1.07

+ Added a seed generation instruction for better RNG in the project
+ Added quarantining functionality to the project
+ Added quaratining ratio as a modifiable parameter in the parameter file

2020-09-21 - version 1.08

+ Added functionality for modeling disease spread with the SLIRS (susceptible, latent, infectious, recovered, susceptible) model
+ Added immunity capability in Individuals to the parameter file

2020-09-23 - version 1.081

+ Changed the simulation grid from a numpy 2D array to a python list of lists
+ Added separate matrix that stores each cell's total exposure points from the Individual's within the simulation grid cell
+ Changed current exposure points calculation function to reflect above addition
- Removed caveat that doesn't create an exposure points class variable in Individual objects who are one of the initially infected

2020-09-28 - version 1.082

+ Fixed memory-overconsumption bug that caused the program to crash when too much memory was being used to create the visualization .gif
+ Added a parameter to the parameter file that allows the user to set how many days the simulation can run (helpful when using SLIRS)

2020-09-30 - version 1.083

+ Changed location of code that determines an Individual's age, mortality, and initial location from main.py to Individual.py
+ Changed code determining an Individual's location or desired location to be a callable method in the Individual class
+ Added initial support for patches (locations in the simulation grid where Individuals are allowed to enter through certain locations only)

2020-10-07 - version 1.09

+ Added pathfinding functionality to Individuals
+ Added class to constants.py to support pathfinding
+ Added simple python script that creates an N x N grid of characters the user defines in the command line
+ Added print statements that inform user of simulation progress when executing
+ Changed parameter file to support the simultaneous simulation of multiple diseases
+ Changed directory tree organization
+ Changed parameter file and its references in project code to reflect changed directory tree

2020-11-04 - version 1.10

+ Added multiple disease support
+ Changed cellular automaton from `main.py`'s sequential code to a class, `Cellular_Automaton.py`.

2020-11-04 - version 1.11

+ Fixed visualization error that would not display the individual's state of health for all modeled diseases
