Pfeifer, et al created a framework in Java 5.0 which considers five phases of disease life cycle (latent, infectious, recovered/removed, incubation, and symptomatic), individuals' state parameters (state of health, age, treatment, quarantining behavior, and movement), and overall simulation world and disease params (natural birth and death rate, disease morbidity, spontaneous infection rate, vectored infection rate, contact infection rate, movement probability, immigration rate, and susceptible again rate). Their simulation took on a wider scale, being tested on disease spread through the entire state of Tyrol. They conducted eight experiments varying different parameters for each. In experiment B, removed all medical treatment. In experiment E and F, a quarantine was introduced after 50 days.

Multiple sources consider a cell capable of holding many individuals. Vaccination simply adds S*w to the recovered stage and subtracts S*w from the susceptible stage.

They did another large-scale framework that makes each cell represent thousands of people. Did not implement age effects on disease spread. Didn't compare results to actual influenza numbers because the data didn't exist.

Used a patch-style approach that improved processing time by restricting CA operations on those cell in the patch. Implemented dynamic populations between patches through pathways. This is a method that could work if someone tried to model students walking through the hallways to go from one class to another (that is, if the school is a one-building school with all classrooms connected by a series of pathways.

Used a geographical information system to define the domain with a polygonal curve, which is then discretized using an unstructured triangular grid where each cell is triangle population by humans and mosquitos. Neglects births and natural death rates of humans, assuming short period times for the disease spread simulation. Each cell can hold multiple humans and skeeters.

One thing I did differently is factor in mask wearing as a disease spread inhibitor. Mine can be open source.
